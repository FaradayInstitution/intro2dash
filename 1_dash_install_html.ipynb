    "\n",
    "Dash allows the components of a web-based application to interact with each other, for example using a dropdown menu to select what to show on a plot. Thus, it builds up from the plotly capabilities, allowing plots to be updated even at real time. Dash produced a dashboard web application at a local url, typically [http://127.0.0.1:8050/](http://127.0.0.1:8050/).\n",
